- JS: background lazy slider, list of reviews that are pulled from the JSON file, the list "My work" is generated from the JSON file as well as the list of services, photos can be opened in full screen format, and the service will open a slider with several examples of procedures, custom calendar which is generated independently and returns the exact date for one of the items of the record for the haircut, the calculation of the cost and the working form that sends the data to the mail.
